Constructs - examples
	Difficult to define and measure 
	Memory
	Happiness
	Guilt
	Intelligence
	Hunger
	Itchiness 
	Age - as in perceived age not chronological age 
	Effort 

Operational definitions -  
	Agreed upon Construct description - enable measurement 
	A way of turning Constructs into variables we can measure 
	A way of describing a variable in terms of the way we measure it 
The operational definition of aggression was the score on the score on the Aggression Scale.

Recognition Score
	Recognize faces you saw before 

Temporal Memory Score
	Remember WHEN you saw each face 

Extraneous Factors - Lurking Variables

Population parameters (such as mu, or μ\mu) are values that describe the entire population.
Sample statistics (such as X-bar) are values that describe our sample; 
we use statistics to estimate the population parameters.
Estimates are our best guesses for the population parameters. So, for example, we would use X-bar to estimate mu.

Population parameter - number that describes the population 

Use x bar - the sample statistic, to approximate the population parameter - mu 




Data - Spreadsheet  lesson 8 /36 has this link to the data 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18yUpkEmTbVja4KUi2_JN8Y7QyPGzzJ_yRE_FrjS-a-A/edit#gid=0

mu - x bar = sampling error - might be wrong

sampling error = sample mean − population mean

X Axis - Independent Variable, Predictor Variable - example Hours slept - raw count how many from Asia
X Axis Histogram numerical quantitative - (age) 
X Axis Bar Graph data is categorical (country), qualitative 

Y Axis - Dependent Variable, or the Outcome - Temporal Memory Score
Histogram - Y Axis - percetage of people from Asia - Frequency on Y Axis - Histogram Frequency on Y Axis 
Trying to Predice Tempporal Memory Score from Hours Slept 

Correlation Does Not Prove Causation 

Frequency Distribution Tables 
Frequency / Absolute Frequency - 2 / 50 
Relative Frequency (proportions) - 0.04 - value range 0 - 1
10% 90% etc - overall percentages - not Relative Frequency (proportions)

Bar Graph - spaces between the bars - Asia, Europe and North America - all their own verticle bar
	distinct categories 
	bin size constant 
Histogram - continuum - age for example not countries 
	Peak - Mode 


sum of deviations should almost always be zero
